Perfect! Let me recap the card system to make sure I understand correctly:

## **Card System Architecture:**

### **Card Lifecycle:**
1. **Initialization:** All CardUI instantiated at Awake()
2. **Starting Position:** Cards begin in Deck
3. **Distribution:** 5 cards per player moved from Deck → Player Hands
4. **Quartet Formation:** Complete suits moved from Player Hand → Quartet Zone

### **Card Management:**
- **CardUI objects** exist throughout the game (never destroyed)
- **Lists manage positioning:** Each manager (Deck, Player, Quartets) has lists
- **Visual movement:** Cards move between UI containers based on list membership
- **PlayerController interface:** Works with CardNetwork for data, but UI handled by card system

### **Current Game Flow (StartGameLogic):**
```csharp
CardManager.Instance.DistributeCards(players);  // Move cards Deck → Player Hands
TurnManager.Instance.StartTurnManager();        // Begin turn sequence
```

## **Integration Points:**
- **PlayerController.AddCardToHand(CardNetwork)** - Updates player data + syncs network
- **CardManager handles UI positioning** - Moves CardUI between containers
- **No manual UI updates needed** - Card system manages its own display

## **For External Script Updates:**
- **Fix method signatures** - Use PlayerController instead of PlayerNetwork
- **Fix parameter types** - Use CardNetwork where needed
- **Keep card positioning logic** - Don't change the visual card system
- **Note game logic issues** for GameFlowManager

**This means we fix interfaces/signatures while preserving your card visual system. Ready for CardManager.cs!**
