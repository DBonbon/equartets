## üéØ **PlayerController as Central Hub - Design Question**


## **The Flow is:**

1. **PlayerState.Score** = **Single Source of Truth** (the actual data)

2. **PlayerUI and PlayerNetwork** = **Reflections/Mirrors** of PlayerState.Score

## **How it Works:**

### **PlayerState holds the real data:**
```cshar
public class PlayerState 
{
    public int Score { get; private set; } = 0; // ‚Üê THE REAL SCORE
    
    public void SetScore(int newScore) 
    { 
        Score = newScore; // Only place score actually changes
    }
}
```

### **PlayerUI reflects/displays the score:**
```csharp
public void UpdateScoreUI(int score)
{
    scoreText.text = "Score: " + score.ToString(); // ‚Üê SHOWS what's in PlayerState
}
```

### **PlayerNetwork syncs the score:**
```csharp
public NetworkVariable<int> Score = new NetworkVariable<int>(0); // ‚Üê SYNCS what's in PlayerState
```

## **Controller Keeps Them in Sync:**
```csharp
public void IncrementScore()
{
    // 1. Change the REAL data
    playerState.SetScore(playerState.Score + 1);
    
    // 2. Update the DISPLAY to reflect the real data
    playerUI.UpdateScoreUI(playerState.Score);
    
    // 3. Update the NETWORK to reflect the real data
    playerNetwork.Score.Value = playerState.Score;
}
```

## **So:**
- **PlayerState.Score** = The truth
- **PlayerUI** = Shows the truth to the player
- **PlayerNetwork** = Syncs the truth to other clients
- **PlayerController** = Makes sure everyone reflects the same truth

**This eliminates data duplication - there's only ONE real score (in PlayerState), everything else just reflects it.**

**Does this clarify the concept? Should we apply the same pattern to HandCards next?**
