NGO Player Spawning Flow
When a player clicks a start button, here's what happens:
1. NetworkManager.StartHost() or StartClient() is called

2. NetworkManager.OnStartHost() or OnStartClient() is called


## Complete NGO Player Spawning Flow

### **Step 1: User Clicks Start Button**
```csharp
// NetworkManagerUI.cs
private void ToggleHost()
{
    NetworkManager.Singleton.StartHost(); // <-- THIS IS THE TRIGGER
}
```

### **Step 2: NetworkManager Internal Processing**
```
NetworkManager.StartHost() calls:
├── StartServer() internally
├── StartClient() internally  
└── Triggers connection establishment
```

### **Step 3: NGO Auto-Spawning (The Magic)**
Once connection is established, NGO automatically:
```
For each connected client:
├── Finds NetworkManager.PlayerPrefab (your PlayerPrefab)
├── Instantiates PlayerPrefab in scene
├── Calls NetworkObject.Spawn() on the prefab
└── Assigns OwnerClientId to the spawned object
```

### **Step 4: Your Scripts Get Called (In Order)**

#### **4a. PlayerPrefab GameObject is created**
```
GameObject "PlayerPrefab(Clone)" created with components:
├── PlayerController.cs (MonoBehaviour)
├── PlayerNetwork.cs (NetworkBehaviour) 
├── PlayerUI.cs (MonoBehaviour)
└── NetworkObject.cs (handles spawning)
```

#### **4b. Unity Lifecycle Methods Fire**
```csharp
// These fire in standard Unity order:
PlayerController.Awake()
PlayerNetwork.Awake()  
PlayerUI.Awake()
│
PlayerController.Start()
PlayerNetwork.Start()
PlayerUI.Start()
```

#### **4c. NGO Network Lifecycle Methods Fire**
```csharp
// AFTER NetworkObject.Spawn() completes:
PlayerNetwork.OnNetworkSpawn() // <-- YOUR MAIN ENTRY POINT
│
// NetworkVariables become available here
// IsServer, IsOwner, IsClient are all valid
// OwnerClientId is assigned
```

### **Step 5: What Should Happen Next (Your Missing Logic)**
```csharp
PlayerNetwork.OnNetworkSpawn() should:
├── Set up canvas reference (UI management)
├── Initialize PlayerController with data (if server)
├── Set NetworkVariable values (if server)
├── Register with PlayerManager
└── Apply UI positioning and visibility
```


Try this implementation and let me know what the debug logs show. The key logs to watch for are:

[PlayerNetwork.OnNetworkSpawn] ENTRY POINT
[ServerInitializationFlow] Initializing PlayerController
[ClientUISetupFlow] Setting canvas reference
PlayerUI: Moved UI container
