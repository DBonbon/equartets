**Recap of Your Requirements:**

**Player Setup:**
- Dynamic 2-4 players from PlayerPrefab (PlayerController, PlayerNetwork, PlayerUI)
- PlayerUI positioned under Canvas (not NetworkObject)
- Currently overlapping, need proper positioning

**PlayerUI Components:**
- **Personal**: Image, name, score (always visible for all players)
- **TurnUI**: Dropdown cards, dropdown player, guess button (only visible when hasTurn==true)
- **PlayerHand**: Displays cards in player.playerhand (only visible for local player)

**Positioning Logic:**
- **Local Player (isLocal=true)**: Always bottom of screen, all UI elements visible
- **Other Players**: Only Personal section visible (no PlayerHand, no TurnUI)
- **2 Players**: Other player at top
- **3 Players**: Second on right, third on top  
- **4 Players**: Bottom (local), right, top, left

**Center Elements**: Deck cards and quartet cards remain in center

**Visual Concept**: Simulates players around a table, but text/images not rotated for readability

**General Approach:**

1. **Dynamic Positioning System**: Create a positioning manager that calculates screen positions based on player count and isLocal status

2. **UI Visibility Management**: Control which UI sections are active based on isLocal and hasTurn states

3. **Anchor/Positioning Strategy**: Use Canvas anchor points (bottom, top, left, right, center) rather than absolute positions for screen resolution independence

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep the positioning logic separate from the player instantiation logic

**Key Considerations:**
- How do you currently determine player order/seating arrangement?
- Do you need to handle dynamic player joining/leaving during gameplay?
- Should the positioning update in real-time or only at game start?
